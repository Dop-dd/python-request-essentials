method which is case sensitive. Here are some of the HTTP request methods:

°° GET: This fetches information from the given server using the
given URI.
°° HEAD: The functionality of this is similar to GET but the difference is,
it delivers only the status line and header section.

given Request-URI.

°° OPTIONS: This specifies the communication options for a
request/response cycle. It lets the client to mention different
options associated with the resource.

the name of the resource. In the previous example, the hostname is the
Request-URI.

request, we can use the requests header fields. They are colon-separated
key value pairs. Some of the request-headers values are:

°° Accept-Charset: This is used to indicate the character sets that are
acceptable for the response.

the authentication information of the user agent.
